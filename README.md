# Throw-Trajectory-Calculation
This script has been written with a Unity Engine in mind however reimplementing it into any other solution could be done quite easly.  
Simply putting it is calculating the trajectory of an object based on a physics trajectory equations.  
It also allows to predict the position in space or the landing spot of an object.
